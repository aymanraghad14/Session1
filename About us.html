  <p>Accessories are stylish and functional items that complement an outfit or enhance a gadget. They range from fashion pieces like jewelry, watches, and handbags to tech add-ons like phone cases and smartwatches. Accessories allow people to express their personality, elevate their style, or improve convenience in daily life. Whether for fashion, utility, or both, the right accessories can make a significant impact.</p>

  <p>Pearl necklaces

    Pearls aren't leaving the fashion scene anytime soon, but now they are being worn in a new way. Forget the strict classic style — now, pearl strands are being combined with chunky chains, tied around neck scarves, or even worn across the shoulder, fastened with a brooch. Pearls are no longer just for business attire; they look fantastic with palazzo pants, t-shirts, and even sportswear.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Bracelets

        In fashion, both chunky cuff bracelets that look striking with turtlenecks and long sleeves, and delicate chains with miniature pendants are in trend. Flora and fauna are also trending — fish, floral motifs, and shells. These details add  a fantastic touch to the accessories.</p>
